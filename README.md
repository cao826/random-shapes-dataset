# random-shapes-dataset

A simple resource for generating images of random shapes. The code here generates images with three different kinds of shapes, each with their own colors. I am using this dataset as a very easy dataset to verify the behavior of a segmentation model I am working on. 

This dataset is inspired by the matterport's MaskRCNN library, which has its own random shapes dataset.
